# 📋 Log Ingestion and Querying System

A full-stack developer tool to ingest and query logs using filters, built with **Node.js**, **React**, and a JSON file-based storage system.

## 🚀 Features

- Ingest structured logs via API or UI form
- Filter logs by:
  - Level (error, warn, info, debug)
  - Message (full-text search)
  - Resource ID
  - Timestamp range
- Sort logs in reverse-chronological order
- Clear filters with one click
- JSON file used for data persistence (no DB)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Joi, fs-extra
- **Frontend:** React, Axios, React-DatePicker
- **Storage:** `logs.json` file

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamkhatik/log-query-system.git
cd log-query-system
```

### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

> Runs at: `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Runs at: `http://localhost:5173`

## ✍️ Design Decisions

- JSON file used for simplicity and to demonstrate in-memory data handling (`fs-extra`)
- Filters use chained `Array.prototype.filter()` with AND logic
- `useState` lifted to `App.jsx` for a single source of truth
- `LogForm` allows manual ingestion and testability
- No DB or global state libs — clean and minimal

## ✅ API Endpoints

### POST `/logs`

```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "message": "Failed to connect",
  "resourceId": "server-1",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-03T12:00:00Z",
  "traceId": "abc-123",
  "spanId": "span-456",
  "commit": "deadbeef",
  "metadata": { "parentResourceId": "server-2" }
}
```

### GET `/logs`

Supports query params:
```
/logs?level=error&resourceId=server-1&timestamp_start=...&timestamp_end=...
```
✅ Additional Features (Bonus Implemented)
🔹 Basic Analytics View
A bar chart was added to show the count of logs grouped by severity level (error, warn, info, debug) using Recharts.

Dynamically reflects current filters

Visually helpful for spotting log trends

Component: LogAnalytics.jsx
## 🧪 Bonus Features (Optional)

- Real-time updates via WebSockets (pending)
- Docker support (not included)
🔹 Unit Testing with Jest
Implemented unit tests for backend log filtering logic.

Tests cover:

Filtering by level, message, timestamp

Combined filters

Located in backend/utils/filterLogs.test.js
```
cd backend
npm test
```
